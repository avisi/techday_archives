# techday-lingo-bingo-2018

Learning new languages is fun and especially languages which you do not encounter everyday. 
In pairs we will dive into a language, investigate the perks and drawbacks of this language and will share our findings at the end of the afternoon.

We will start at 15:00 and end our search for the holy grail at 17:00 at which we will ask our meetup compagnions to present their findings. Please try to highlight some pros and cons and applicability in your daily work.
